title:  "Difference between a junior and a senior engineer"
---

3 years ago I got my first job as software engineer, writing university projects and ship **real working**
software it's very different, I learnt a lot of things that forged my mind.

I started from writing little features and end up to bigger ones. Step by step I found patterns better then others, and learn how to write better quality code.

I dealt with different kind of software, written by fellow juniors and seniors developers and I saw different approaches about dealing with problems.

## Code quality

A great junior engineer is very idealistic, he wants to write very clean code with blending edge tools. He spots a lot of troubles or bad practices on already written production code and wants to rewrite everything to make it better.

A senior engineer has written a lot of software, he agrees with the junior about bad written code but does not want to change it, because **it works**. A junior developer hates this word but it's true. If something works, you don't need to waste your time changing it, and the best explanation I've read is this:

> "Well," they say, "look at this function. It is two pages long! None of this stuff belongs in there! I don't know what half of these API calls are for." Yes, I know, it's just a simple function to display a window, but it has grown little hairs and stuff on it and nobody knows why. Well, I'll tell you why: *those are bug fixes*

> The idea that new code is better than old is patently absurd. Old code has been used. It has been tested. Lots of bugs have been found, and they've been fixed. There's nothing wrong with it. It doesn't acquire bugs just by sitting around on your hard drive.

> Quote from [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html)

So do we have to stay always with the same software because it works? And that's the problem, sometimes you need to change. I did two rewrite on my career, one succeeded and one not. Why? My answer now is that you need to rewrite if it *does not work*. If a software is not good because does not fit your scenario anymore, (because does not scale, because cannot provide more features or whatever) then may be an idea to rewrite or refactor. There is a subtle balance between the **bug shower** you will get and the gain you will accomplish with your change, is it worth to do it? Evaluating this is a job for a senior engineer.

## Tools

A senior engineer used a bunch of technologies. May be good but sometimes is a trap, because tend to deal with a problem using always the same tools, sometimes they are still good, sometimes not.

A junior engineer has a great quality: *he knows nothing*. He sees problems from the first time and it's a quality because he can find solutions from a different angle that experienced engineers don't find. Junior engineers are amazed by new tools of any kind: languages, databases, frameworks etc. So he wants to use them on his projects.

Is the job of the senior to understand if a software can really make an improvement on the project and fight his attitude of staying inside the **well known** circle.

## New projects

When comes to a new project a junior engineer wants to write everything from scratch, because he does not like any similar projects around. Seniors instead tends to start from a similar tool and modify it to fullfill required needs. Why?

The main problem is that reading software is harder than writing it, junior finds hard to read software written by others and so he says that it's bad. A senior instead sees a huge advantage, that software has a lot of bugs already fixed. Starting from scratch you will end up on those bugs and you have to waste time fixing them!

## Conclusion

I learnt that any production software is always **bad**, it has some bad practices, 1000 lines of code functions, uses a database not good for the scope and more. This because when you begin writing a software you don't know what you want. Software it's like a sculture, you start from a blank screen and begin to engraving your code. You discover step by step what your software should do and you can't start again from scratch at any change. The difference between a good software and a bad one is that a well written software is easy to change even if it has some bad practices inside.

Seniors engineer should bootstrap a software because they have more experience about bad and good practices. Juniors instead can learn from them and provide their new ideas.
