Last October I did one of the hardest decision of my life, I left my job.
It was my first job, I joined that company for an internship and then a continued as a full-time engineer. They tought me what means beeing an engineer, from a simple intern to one of core engineers of the company. I had a 9to5 job with a permament position, some people, even my collegues felt that they "have arrived". You have a permanent position, what do you want more?

But after two years working there I started to be very stressed, every day I was losing the fun of what I was doing. I did a lot of amazing things, I have played a key role on a lot of improvements that my engineering team gave to company platform. At a certain point, they gave me a task that annoyed me a lot. It was a mixture of two tasks that I did before.

I know that a job is not full of fun every day, you have to do things that you love but also things that you don-t like at all. So I sayed to myself: Luca, complete this task, the next will be more interesting. This was the motivation that I used in past and worked well.

The task assigned went very bad, it was a revolution for the platform and this time I failed, it didn't work well. Then it was the time for holidays, I went in a trip in Silicon Valley where I met a lot of interesting people, a lot of stories and I learnt a lot of things about life and career.

Coming back home I was hoping that something changed, that I could go back to work with a good spirit and complete the task. But it was the same, as I have never been three weeks away.

I decided that it was the time to retire, in Silicon VAllyer I learnt that you have to do what you like. I was not liking what I was doing everyday, so I decided to quit my job and look for a new adventure. A very hard decision, but I felt inside my self that it was the correct one.

It was very hard to understand this decision for my collegues, one of them said: that's our work, we have to do it; I don't like it neither but I do it everyday.

I think that it's different, you have to enjoy what you do.

So I started to look around, I received a lot of congratulations for my choice by a lot of friends and my family. I was happy for having their support and I felt that everything will go well anyway.

I spent my first day off sending CVs to all the world. The day after I received a lot of responses. Very great, it was a great satisfation. I took some time to work on my side projects, it was very amazing too.

I accepted an offer from a startup from Silicon Valley. Starting a new job isn't easy. After you learning a job you fell very productive, I had a lot of knowledge and complete a lot of tasks everyday. When you start a new job you have to start again from zero. Anything you say, it is wrong. And it's very frustrating. Also I changed from a work shift of 8 hours from 9 to 6, to a job with free working hours. I can work whenever I like, from wherever I want, they didn't care. Seems easy but it's not. I suffered a lot staying at home all day too. It's very difficult.

After some months I started to feel better and now I can say. Yes, that was the correct decision to make. I'm in a period of my life when I can do whatever I want, why should I not follow my heart?

# Learning is important

On my previous job I was unhappy because I stopped learning. If you stop learning you start to get stressed. Doing new things, learn new things is one of the most important things in a job.

# Don't fall in love on how you do your job

I worked with some very interesting technologies in my previous job, I enjoyed expecially one of them. I felt that everything could be solved with it. It's wrong, if you do this mistake you get biased and you can not do a good job.
Computer engineering is engineering everytime but different problems should be resolved in different ways. If you are not neutral, you may not do the right choice.

# I will not go back to a 9to5 job

having free working hours is fantastic. When it was winter I went to the office with the sun and I went back with the dark, I didn't live the day. It's very sad. Now I can manage my day how I prefer.
I go to the swimming pool in the morning, or whereever I like. I cook whatever I desire instead of having lunch at bakery every day. I can go to luch with my girlfriend and spend more time with here. All this still working 8 hours per day. It's amazing.

# Working from home is amazing

I think I can't work from home for the rest of my life, but right now it's very amazing. I save money for the fuel, stress for driving, stress for eating bad and enjoy more my life. I think that a combination of working from home and from office is the best to combination to avoid routine and having a social life with collegues.
