Sometimes people ask if I'm a developer, an engineer or a programmer. Some time ago, at work, seeing me disappointed for what was happening, people asked me what I like most: do you like to code?

My answer is: No, I like **engineering**.

For me computer engineering is not coding, is not designing, is not system administration. It's all of them.

Computer engineering means for me building a product: design, coding, deploying are all part of it. So I enjoy do these things because I like engineering, I like all these things when they are together not alone.

The most common task of an engineer is building a product. It means, thinking about what you want to do, want the customer wants. If the customer really said to you what he wants, if he is missing something.

Then when you know what you want, you have to design how to do build it. Which piece of software you need, which ones you need to code by yourself, which kind of infrastructure you need to deploy it.

Then you can start to code, to configure your infrastructure. Probably you have forgot something, so you have to iterate again on previous step to correct some mistakes.

When you have finished your work, it's the time to put it in production, and looking for what your customer thinks about it.

If your customer is happy of the results, then you have done a good job!
