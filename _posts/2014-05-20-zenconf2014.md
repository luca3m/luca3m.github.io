On 4 June I will be part of **Zenconf 2014**.
I'm organizing this conference together with other friends. Everyone will talk
about his experience with a technology he have used at work.

Our goal is to share our passion with students, and let them know something new, different
from University courses.

Specifically I will talk about [Redis](http:/redis.io), a key-value database
server with which I have worked in last year and I like very much. After my brief
introduction about Redis, we will have as guest its creator:
[Salvatore Sanfilippo](https://twitter.com/antirez). He will talk more deeply
about Redis, telling us something about its history and main technical
tradeoffs.

There will be also other talks about
[SOLID code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_\(object-oriented_design\)),
[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org),
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) and more. All
details can be found on [Zenconf 2014 website](https://zencoders.org/zenconf/2014/index.html).
